# Codebase map

One file: `index.html`, ~2,550 lines, no build, no dependencies, no network calls. Three zones in
order: **tokens + CSS**, **markup for every screen**, **data + render functions**.

Line numbers below drift as soon as you edit. Grep for the marker instead — every section has one.

## Layout of the file

| Zone | Find it with | What's there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tokens | `AXIOM TOKENS` | Axiom core colours, semantic tokens, spacing scale, the validated dataviz palette |
| CSS | after `*{box-sizing` | Utilities, then components, each with a comment header |
| Markup | `<!-- ======== ` | One `<section class="page" id="page-*">` per screen |
| Data | `const [A-Z_]* =` | Every list the UI renders from |
| Render | `function render*` | One per screen or block |
| Interaction | `/* ACE — the switch` onwards | Delegated click handler, filters, tabs, nav |
| Boot | `/* boot */` | The render chain — **read the failure mode below** |

## Screens

Each is a `<section class="page">`; `goto(page)` unhides one, hides the rest, and syncs `location.hash`
to the page name — every screen has its own URL, so any of them can be copied out of the address bar
and shared. `KNOWN_PAGES` (derived from the `.page` ids) gates which hashes `goto` will act on.

Pages with tabs (Engagements' AI/Custom, Loyalty's Overview/Configuration) get a deeper
`#page/tab` hash, so a link can point at "Custom engagement" specifically, not just Engagements.
`syncHash()` reads the currently visible page and, if it has one, its currently active tab
(`currentTabFor(page)`, which just reads whichever `.tabItem` inside that page carries `.on`) and
writes the combined hash — called from `goto()` and from the `[data-tab]` click handler, so both a
plain page nav and a same-page tab switch keep the URL honest. `landOnHash()` is the read side: it
parses `page/tab` off `location.hash`, calls `goto(page,{fromHash:true})`, and only calls
`selectTab(tab)` if that tab actually exists on that page — a stray or mistyped tab segment is
ignored rather than landing on a blank tab area. A `hashchange` listener and a boot-time call to
`landOnHash()` make the URL work both ways — navigate and it updates, land on a link and it opens
there.

| id | Nav item | Rendered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page-overview` | Reporting | `renderReport` → `renderTiles`, `renderRevTable`, `stackedBars`/`lines`/`hBars`; plus `renderBench` |
| `page-opportunities` | Opportunities | `renderOpportunities` → `renderOpportunityDetail`; actions route into campaigns, guardrails, ACE themes, lifecycle and loyalty |
| `page-engagements` | Engagements | `renderAce` (AI tab — themes **and** their plays), `renderEng` (Custom tab) |
| `page-campaigns` | Campaigns | `renderCampaigns` |
| `page-campaign-new` | (via Create) | `resetWizard` → `askTurn`/`campAnswer` drive a linear script (`WIZARD`), rendering `renderRules`/`renderVariants` inline as cards |
| `page-guardrails` | Guardrails | `renderGuardrails` (master/detail over `GR_CATS`) → `renderSuppression`, `renderExclusions` |
| `page-channels` | Channels | `renderChannels` (master/detail over `CHANNELS`, same `.lcWrap`/`.lcItem` shape as Lifecycle and Guardrails) |
| `page-lifecycle` | Lifecycle | `renderLifecycle` |
| `page-conversations` | Conversations | `renderConv`, `renderThread` |
| `page-loyalty` | Loyalty | `renderLoyalty` — overview tab plus a master/detail over tiers, earn rules and rewards |
| `page-soon` | — | placeholder for anything not built |

`NAV_OF` maps a page to the nav item that should look active — that's how `campaign-new` keeps
Campaigns highlighted.

## Data objects

Change these, not the markup, when you want different content.

| Const | Drives |
| --- | --- |
| `ENG` | The Custom engagement table — **merchant-written only**. `when` is `{ev, delay, cond}` (indexes into `WHEN_EVENTS` / `WHEN_DELAYS`, plus a free-text condition), `ins` is `Default` or `Customized`, `st` is `on`/`off` |
| `WHEN_EVENTS` / `WHEN_DELAYS` | The trigger vocabulary the When block edits |
| `ACE_DOMAINS` | The two-layer theme table (variable name kept as "domain" in code — see below). A theme carries `on`, `ins` and a `plays` array; **it carries no metrics of its own** — see below |
| `ACE_DOMAINS[i].plays[j]` | One play. Real metrics (`reach`, `gmv`, `cvr`, `opt`) and/or the modelled ones (`potReach`, `potGmv`, `potCvr`, `potOpt`); `trg` is the trigger phrase, `ins` the badge, `on` the play's own switch (`undefined`/`true` = on, `false` = off), `st:"setup"` + `note` marks one blocked on an integration |
| `ACE_MODES` | The three mode cards. `sum` is the headline, `brief` the one-liner on the card, `det`/`see`/`who` fill the Learn more panel |
| `ACE_CHAIN` | The six agent steps, shown inside Learn more |
| `CONV` | The conversations inbox. `why` is the one-line reason, `whyBullets` (optional) the evidence behind it, `reason` the key/value reasoning rows, `thread` the messages, `stop` the guardrail that blocked it, `fb` the feedback-loop state (`{vote, note, sent}`, lazily created by `convFeedback()` the first time a thread renders) |
| `STAGES` | The seven lifecycle stages. `lever` holds indexes into `LEVERS`; `capN`/`capU` are the message cap value and unit |
| `LEVERS` / `LEVER_CFG` | Lever names, and per-lever configuration fields keyed by lever index |
| `TONE_TEXT` | The prefilled tone textarea, keyed by stage name |
| `OBJECTIVES`, `DISCOUNTS`, `CAP_UNITS` | The dropdown option lists on a lifecycle stage |
| `SUPPRESSION` / `EXCLUSIONS` | The two guardrail blocks — timing vs people. `locked: true` means it can't be toggled |
| `TIERS`, `EARN`, `REWARDS` | Loyalty. Tiers carry structured `cond` rows so the editor opens populated |
| `PRODUCT_OPPORTUNITIES` | Horizontal, account-pattern recommendations for Guardrails, Lifecycle and Loyalty; each opens an evidence and action panel |
| `OPPORTUNITIES` | The cross-product conversational opportunity inbox, including evidence, impact, proposal fields and action routing |
| `DIMS` | The reporting dimensions. Each member carries a weekly base, a growth rate and **its own rates** — every number on the page is derived from those, so no two figures can disagree. `source` is ACE / Custom / Campaign; ACE absorbed the old `Default` volume when the standard engagements became plays |
| `METRICS` | The ten outbound metrics, each with a kind (`count` / `money` / `rate`) and a direction |
| `GR_CATS` | The seven guardrail categories driving the master/detail. A category is built from optional pieces — `fields` (short value inputs), `toggles`, `select`, plus per-category special blocks (`levers`, `banned`, `list`, `kill`) — `renderGuardrails` checks each and appends the matching markup, so a new category is additive: reuse the pieces that fit, skip the rest |
| `CHANNELS` | The seven rows in the Channels master/detail — SMS through TikTok Shop. `sends` is the list of already-connected identities the "Sends as" picker offers; `extra` (optional) is settings that only apply to that one channel, e.g. Email's quiet-hours exemption; `chSel` (like `grSel`/`stg`) holds which row is open |
| `WEEKS`, `BENCH` | The 12-week axis and the benchmark rows |
| `CAMPAIGNS`, `CAMP_METRICS`, `VARIANTS`, `RULES`, `WIZ`, `WIZ_CHECKS` | Campaigns list, selectable performance columns and the wizard |
| `SIM_SHOPPERS` | The shoppers you can run a live test against |
| `PREV_*` | Word pools for `genPreview(n)`, the pre-launch campaign preview |

## The two-layer theme table

`ACE_DOMAINS` holds no metrics. Every figure on a theme row is folded from its plays, so the row
and the rows under it cannot drift apart:

- `playReal(p)` / `playPot(p)` — one play's measured and modelled numbers. `playPot` falls back to
  the real ones, so an active play only needs `potX` fields where they differ.
- `playLive(d,p,aceOn)` — is this play actually running? False if ACE is off, the theme is off, the
  play's own switch (`p.on`) is off, or the play is `st:"setup"`.
- `fold(rows)` — sums reach and GMV and **re-derives** cvr and opt from the reach they were measured
  on. Never an average of averages.
- `domTotals(d,aceOn)` — the live fold, or `null` when nothing under the theme is running.
- `domPotential(d)` — the fold of every play's modelled numbers, including the off and blocked ones.
  This is what the italics show, and what the "GMV left on the table" tag sums.

`aceOpen` is a `Set` of expanded theme indexes; it starts empty — the theme row already carries the
folded figures, so the plays only appear on click. `data-domopen` sits on the whole theme row (not just the chevron) so clicking anywhere
on it expands or collapses that theme; it must be checked **after** the row's own controls
(`data-dom`, `data-dominstr`) in the delegated click handler, or a click on either of those would
just toggle the row instead of doing what it says. `#aceExpandAll` toggles every theme at once.

**A play's own switch (`p.on`, via `data-play="i.j"`) never outranks its theme's.** `playLive`
ANDs both together, so turning a theme off still overrides every play under it regardless of the
play's own setting — the two-layer rule from §3b of PRODUCT.md holds; a play just narrows *within*
an allowed theme now, instead of having no dial at all.

`updateNavCount()` sets the Engagements nav badge from *both* layers: live plays plus custom
engagements that are on. It is called by `renderAce` and `renderEng`, so either one keeps it honest.

## The studio's When block

`openStudio(ctx)` renders `whenBlock(ctx)` above the skill. Three shapes, driven by `ctx.when`:

| `ctx.when` | Shape | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| absent | "There's nothing to set" — the engine owns timing | `studioForDomain` |
| `{mode:"read", line, domain}` | The trigger, stated, tagged *Set by the engine* | `studioForPlay` |
| `{mode:"edit", ev, delay, cond}` | A trigger you set, described in a sentence first, exact rules as the fallback | `studioForEng`, `studioForNew` |

For `mode:"edit"`, the sentence (`#studioNl`) is the primary surface — same "describe it, rules
are the fallback" order as campaign audience (§8 of PRODUCT.md). `whenToSentence(w)` renders the
current `{ev,delay,cond}` back as English for an existing engagement; `studioForNew` seeds a worked
example instead, since there's no trigger yet to describe. `#whenModeToggle` swaps between
`#whenNlWrap` and `#whenRulesWrap` (the old two-select-plus-condition form) without touching either
one's underlying fields — they both write to the same hidden `#whenEv`/`#whenDelay`/`#whenCond`,
which is what `whenReadback()` and Save actually read. **Interpret** is decorative like the rest of
the studio: for a brand-new engagement it fills in a canned example; for an existing one it just
re-confirms the read-back, since the sentence shown was generated from that engagement's real
trigger in the first place.

`whenReadback()` rebuilds the English sentence on every change; it is wired in `openStudio` only when
the block is editable. `ctx.nl` adds the describe-and-interpret box on top, which is the old
`NEW_BODY` panel folded into the studio — the dead end CODEBASE.md used to warn about is gone.

## The reporting engine

`DIMS[dim].members[i]` holds a weekly base, a growth rate and per-member rates. `prim(m,i,w)`
expands that into six primitives for one week — reached, replies, clicks, orders, optouts, gmv.
Everything else is derived:

- `metricAt(key,m,i,w)` — one member, one week
- `metricTotal(key,m,i)` — one member over the period
- `fromTotals(key,totals)` — a metric from summed primitives

**Rates are always re-derived from period totals, never averaged across weeks.** That is why the
chart, the tiles and the revenue table can never disagree — there is one source of truth and three
projections of it. There is a test for this in WORKFLOW.md.

`repSeries()` takes the top four members and folds the rest into `Other`, re-deriving Other's
values from primitives so its rates stay honest.

**Colour is bound to the member, not to its rank.** Assignment happens once at load: the four
biggest members of each dimension take the four categorical hues, everything else is `--dv-other`.
Changing metric or view can never repaint a series.

## Mutable state

Mutable module-scope state includes `aceState`, `engFilter`, `stg` (selected lifecycle stage),
`convFilter`/`convSel`/`convQ`, `campColumns`, `wizStep`, `studio`, `chSel` (selected channel).
Every one of them is followed by a `render*` call — there is no reactive layer, so **if you mutate
state you must re-render**. A few pieces of state live on the data object itself instead of a
module-scope variable, because they need to survive being scrolled past and back: `c.unread`,
`c.sending`, and `c.fb` (the Conversations feedback loop) all live on the `CONV` row they belong
to, not in a variable that only knows about whichever conversation is currently open.

## Mobile

One breakpoint, `@media (max-width:880px)`, in a single CSS block near the end of `<style>` (search
`MOBILE`) so it always cascades after every other rule it needs to override. Below it:

- **The sidebar becomes an off-canvas drawer.** `.sidebar` is `position:fixed`, translated off-screen
  by default; `.sidebar.open` slides it in. `#mobileMenuBtn` (a hamburger, floating fixed top-left,
  `display:none` above the breakpoint) toggles it via `openSidebar()`/`closeSidebar()`;
  `#sidebarBackdrop` dims the page and closes it on click; clicking a nav item closes it too
  (`goto()` doesn't know about the drawer — it's viewport state, not page state — so the nav item's
  own click handler calls `closeSidebar()` after `goto()`). `body:has(#panel.on) .mobileMenuBtn`
  hides the hamburger while a side panel is open — both float in the same top-left corner, and the
  panel already has its own close button.
- **Master/detail lists go horizontal.** `.lcWrap` drops to one column; `.lcList` flips to a
  horizontally-scrolling row of pills instead of a vertical list, since a vertical list of 7-8 items
  each spanning the full width would push the detail below the fold. Covers Guardrails, Lifecycle,
  Channels and Loyalty's tier/program lists for free — they all already used `.lcList`/`.lcItem`.
- **The Conversations inbox and Opportunities workspace stack** — list on top with a capped
  `max-height` and its own scroll, detail below. `.inboxResize` (the desktop drag handle) is hidden;
  dragging a vertical stack apart isn't a meaningful action once the columns are gone.
- **Tables scroll horizontally instead of losing columns.** The global `table{width:100%}` rule is
  what makes columns compress illegibly on a narrow screen; `.card:has(table) table{width:max-content}`
  lets a table claim its natural width inside a `.card:has(table){overflow-x:auto}` wrapper, so the
  hidden columns are a swipe away instead of gone. The `!important` on `overflow-x` is load-bearing —
  several table cards set `overflow:hidden` inline for their rounded corners, and inline styles beat
  an external stylesheet rule for the same property regardless of selector specificity.
- **Label-left, control-right rows wrap.** `.row.between` (a guardrail toggle, a lifecycle field,
  Channels' "Optimize for") is the single most common settings-row shape, and none of the dozens of
  call sites were built expecting to wrap — several carry an inline `style="max-width:70%"` (or 76%)
  on the label sized for a wide desktop row. `.row.between{flex-wrap:wrap}` plus a blanket
  `[style*="max-width"]{max-width:100% !important}` override fixes all of them at once rather than
  editing each call site. `flex-wrap:wrap` alone never forces a row that already fits to break, so
  this is safe on rows that were never a problem.
- **Two headers build their own markup instead of using `.pageHeader`** — Opportunities
  (`.oppMasterHead`) and the studio panel's own header. Both got their own hamburger-clearance
  padding rather than inheriting `.pageHeader`'s; if a future page does the same, it needs the same
  treatment, `.pageHeader`'s fix won't reach it.

If you add a new two-column layout or a new label+control row, it should already work at 390px
without a special case — check it against this section before assuming it needs one.

## Panels

`openPanel(title, sub, bodyHTML, footHTML)` fills the single `#panel`. `closePanel()` hides it.

The studio can become a wide two-column variant, but starts single-column at the normal panel
width — testing is secondary to the skill itself, so it costs no width until asked for.
`openStudio` explicitly removes `wide` up front (so a stale state from a previous studio session
can't leak in), and the body's `#studioTestCol` starts `hidden` inside a `.studio` grid that
defaults to one column. Clicking "Test this skill" or "Run test" calls the shared `openTest()`
closure, which adds `wide` to the panel, `testOpen` to `#studioGrid` (switching the grid to
`3fr 2fr`), and un-hides `#studioTestCol`. `openPanel` also strips `wide` whenever the body isn't a
studio, and `closePanel` clears it after the transition — so a normal panel never inherits the wide
width either way.

Entry points: `studioForEng(i)` for an engagement, `studioForDomain(i)` for a theme,
`studioForPlay(i,j)` for a play, `openLearn(k)` for a mode, `openShoppers(stage)` → `openShopper(s)`,
`openTier(i)` (`null` for a new tier).

## The live test

`simOpener(ctx, shopper)` produces the first message. `simReply(text)` matches the merchant's typed
reply against keyword groups (sizing / price / problem / refusal / anything else) and returns
`{msg, note}` — the note is the reasoning line under the thread. `studioSay()` appends and schedules
the reply; `drawStudio()` repaints.

To add a behaviour to the simulation, add a branch to `simReply`. Keep the `note` honest about which
rule produced the answer — that note is the whole point of the feature.

## The resizeable conversation list

`.inbox` is a three-track grid: the list, a 6px `#convResize` handle, then the thread. The list's
width lives on `--convListW`, a CSS custom property on `.inbox` with `344px` as the CSS-side
default — so as long as nothing ever sets the property, the layout is exactly what it was before
this existed. Dragging updates `--convListW` directly via `inbox.style.setProperty`, clamped to
240–560px; double-click calls `removeProperty` to fall back to the CSS default. Because the width
lives on the grid container rather than in any state `renderConv()` touches, a re-render (new
filter, new search term) can never reset it — `renderConv()` only ever replaces
`#convItems`/`#convThread` innerHTML, not `.inbox` itself.

## Charts

Hand-rolled inline SVG, no library. The main time-series view always uses `lines`, regardless of
metric type: cardinal-spline curves, subtle per-series gradient fills, an animated draw, shared
crosshair and hover points. It **measures `host.clientWidth`** and generates at 1:1 so text doesn't
get downscaled; the report re-runs on a debounced resize. The same data also has ranked and table
views through the `data-view` segmented control.

**Palette.** `--dv-1 #7e55f6` (purple, ACE) · `--dv-2 #c35e4a` (coral) · `--dv-3 #149db8` (teal,
Default) · `--dv-4 #0e4ea7` (blue), plus `--dv-other #b3b8c1`. Axiom steps validated **on all
pairs**, not just adjacent ones — the earlier blue/purple pairing failed the normal-vision floor
(ΔE 11.5, under 15) and was genuinely hard to tell apart in the line chart. The set is on
`<body data-palette>`. **If you change a series colour, re-run the validator** (see WORKFLOW.md);
don't eyeball it.

**Stat tiles** match the Gorgias metric card: label, info icon and a `+`, a large tabular number,
a delta whose direction comes from a rotated arrow rather than from colour, and a full-bleed
`sparkline()` with a gradient fill. They are **read-only and account-wide** — deliberately
independent of the report below them.

Stacked bars put the 2px gap on the *top* of each segment except the topmost, so the bottom segment
stays anchored to the baseline. Only the topmost segment gets the 4px rounded end.

## Conventions

- No hex colours in new CSS — use the semantic tokens.
- Spacing only from the scale: `--xxxxs` 2 → `--xxl` 48.
- Type through the `.h-*` / `.t-*` classes; never a raw font-size.
- Chart text wears ink tokens, never the series colour. Identity comes from the legend, the swatch
  and the direct label — never colour alone.
- New interactive things use `data-*` attributes and the delegated document click handler, not
  per-node listeners, so they survive a re-render.
- Copy is plain English, no em-dash-free rule but no jargon either. It reads like a colleague
  explaining the product, because half the prototype's job is the copy.

## Ranked and table views

`hBars` is a single-measure chart, so it uses one hue — ranking is magnitude, not identity. The
table view is not a nicety: the dataviz rules require a table alternative wherever colour carries
meaning.

## The campaign wizard

`page-campaign-new` is a single scrolling conversation, not three static panels. `WIZARD` is a
linear script of turns; each has an `ask`, `hint`, `chips`, an `ack` (string or a function of the
answer), and an optional `card` (function returning HTML shown after the ack). `askTurn()` renders
the next question; `campAnswer()` echoes what the merchant typed, shows a typing indicator, then the
ack and card, then advances. The Who/What/How stepper at the top is a **passive status bar** — it is
not clickable and does not drive the flow; `wizIdx` (position in `WIZARD`) is the only source of
truth, and `wizStep` is derived from it for display.

`resetWizard()` runs on every `goto("campaign-new")`, clearing the thread and restoring `VARIANTS`
to its starting three — so opening a new campaign is always a fresh conversation, and demoing it
twice doesn't accumulate a stale variant list from the last run.

**The flow, turn by turn.** The script is longer than three steps because the stepper is passive —
the conversation can revisit a step's substance more than once:

1. **Opening pitch** — the Cirrus launch is argued, not just named: the gap (shell owners with no
   mid-layer), the moment (first sub-zero forecast), the fit (compatibility, not replacement), the
   size (≈$42k). `opportunityCard()` lays out the why.
2. **Audience, recommended first** — rather than asking the merchant to describe an audience from
   nothing, the wizard proposes one (`audienceCard()`), states why it's the recommendation, and
   invites adjustment in plain words. The answer re-renders the card with the adjustment applied
   (e.g. "only those active this winter, skip recent returners" adds the two chips). A merchant who
   wants their own says so and the next turn takes the description. Exact rules remain the fallback.
3. **The story becomes a skill in blocks** — the answer is drafted into `skillBlocksCard()`: four
   labelled blocks (Product / Angle & tone / Offer / Never say), because a real skill is a long,
   complex instruction and reviewing it means reacting to specific parts, not one wall of text. The
   next turn is the back-and-forth: the merchant comments ("don't mention price at all", "make it
   less salesy", "add the warranty") and the matching block is rewritten and the card re-shown.
4. **A/B test or not** — a plain question: "Do you want to A/B test this, or send one version to
   everyone?" `wizAB` records it. Testing calls `resetVariants()` for three approaches; one version
   collapses `VARIANTS` to a single `singleVariant()` and `variantCard()` reads "The message" /
   "One version, sent to everyone". Downstream, `WIZ_CHECKS()` (a function, not a constant, for
   this reason) swaps its Discount-ceiling line, and `launchCampaign` marks the campaign
   "Testing 3 skills" or "One skill".

**Every recommendation tag opens a Learn more.** Each tag on the opportunity, audience and
skill-block cards is a `button.tagBtn` carrying `data-wizlearn="key"`. `WIZ_LEARN` maps the key to a
title, a subtitle and the detailed instruction; `openWizLearn(k)` shows it in the side panel,
read-only, with a **"Use as my answer"** action (`data-useanswer`) that prefills the compose box
(`#campSay`) with the instruction and closes the panel — so the merchant sees the full text land,
can personalize it, and sends it back as their own reply. It is the same pattern at every stage:
the recommendation is always inspectable, and always editable before it's committed.

**The preview is a question, not a default block.** The wizard's last turn asks whether the
merchant wants to see what would actually send; only a "yes" answer calls `genPreview(n)` and opens
a scrollable side panel (`openPreviewPanel`) of n generated conversations. `genPreview(n)` builds
plausible conversations from word pools, splitting the variants the way the wave would and marking
roughly one in nine as deferred by a collision — it is index-driven, so the same n always produces
the same set. `openPreviewConv(i)` opens one as a full thread with the skill that produced
it, with a "Back to the list" action. Nothing about it simulates the model; it exists so a merchant
can see the shape and tone of a send before committing.

## Known dead ends

`TEST_BODY` is a template string for the page-level Test buttons (`data-act^="test"`, currently only
the Lifecycle stage tester). It predates the studio and overlaps with it. `NEW_BODY` was the other
half of that pair and is gone — "New engagement" now opens `studioForNew()`, so creating and editing
a custom engagement are the same panel. `TEST_BODY` could go the same way.
